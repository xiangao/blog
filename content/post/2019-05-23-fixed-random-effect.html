title: Fixed or Random Effect, or Both?
---



<div id="panel-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Panel data</h1>
<p>When we have a panel data (repeated observations over time, or observations clustered at higher level), we usually think of two choices: random effect or fixed effect? Economists usually prefers fixed effect models, since it wipes out all within unit heterogeneity. Economists do not like random effect models since it has a big assumption: the random effects need to be uncorrelated to other covariates in the model. To see this, suppose we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_{it} = \beta_0  + \beta_1 x_{it} + c_i + \epsilon_{it} \]</span></p>
<p>Suppose we have individuals <span class="math inline">\(i=1, ... , n\)</span> measured at time <span class="math inline">\(t=1, ..., T\)</span>. Here <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> is the unobserved time-invariant individual effects. The difference between fixed and random effects is in how they handle <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Fixed effect models for a linear model can be implemented by one of these two methods: with dummies of individuals, or run an OLS with de-meaned <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. These two methods are equivalent. In a non-linear model, things are more difficult, except Poisson model, other non-lienar model with dummies suffer “incidental parameter” problem. The gold-standard is to do a conditional likelihood (conditional logit for example), which “obsorbs” the fixed effects in the likelihood function, therefore it’s not necessary to estimate them. Unfortunately most non-linear models do not have such nice conditional likelihood. In that case we can only hope the bias would be small (it does get smaller when you have deeper panel, that is , number of observations per individual).</p>
<p>Random effect models treat <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> as part of the error term. In that case, it comes the biggest drawback: the covariates have to be uncorrelated with the error term to have a consistent estimator. Therefore in the above equation, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has to be uncorrelated with <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>, which economists in general do not think it’s realistic.</p>
</div>
<div id="time-invariant-variables" class="section level1">
<h1>Time-invariant variables</h1>
<p>Sometimes people are interested in the effect of time-invariant variables, thus the model</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_{it} = \beta_0  + \beta_1 x_{it} + c_i  + \gamma z_i+ \epsilon_{it} \]</span></p>
<p>Fixed effect models cannot handle this, because <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is not identified because <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> is perfectly collinear with <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>. Random effect can still be estimated, treating <span class="math inline">\(z_i\)</span> simply as another covariate.</p>
</div>
<div id="between-within-model" class="section level1">
<h1>Between-within model</h1>
<p>Usually we were told to do a Hausman test to see whether we should use fixed effect or random effect model. The basic idea is the random effect is more efficient if the assumptions are satisfied. If not, then fixed effect model is still consistent. The Hausman test is to compare the difference between the two. If the difference is small then stick with random effect. If it’s big, then fixed effect should be preferred since it’s consistent.</p>
<p>However, there is a between-within model (BW) that can incorporate both. Neuhaus and Kalbfleisch (1998)(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9629647" class="uri">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9629647</a>) introduced BW estimator,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_{it} = \beta_0  + \beta_1 (x_{it} - \bar x_i) + \beta_2 \bar x_i + c_i  + \gamma z_i+ \epsilon_{it} \]</span></p>
<p>It can be shown that <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the same as the one in the fixed effect model. It is the effect of within individual deviation of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on within individual deviation of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> is the effect of mean of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on mean of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, that is, the “between” effect. <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is the effect of time-invariant variable on the mean of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>The other specification of BW estimator is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y_{it} = \beta_0  + \beta_1 x_{it}  + \beta_2 \bar x_i + c_i  + \gamma z_i+ \epsilon_{it} \]</span></p>
<p>This is just some transformation of the original specification, it’s the same model. <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is exactly the same as before, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> becomes the difference between “within” and “between” effects. This is called “contextual model”, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> is the “contextual” effect. See Neuhaus and Kalbfleisch (1998)(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2014.7" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2014.7</a>). In this specification, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> is acutally similar to a Hausman test. It shows the difference between “between” and “within”.</p>
<p>One advantage of BW model is that it can incorporate fixed effect models along with a random effect estimation, thus including time-invariant covariates becomes possible. A second advantage is that it can do more complicated models, such as cross-level interactions, random slopes, or other multi-level models.</p>
<p>The actual implementation of the simplest form of BW is easy: simply use random effect models on the above two equations.</p>

<p>We can see these two gives the same fixed effect estimation. “panelr” in addition estimates the effect of “blk” and “fem” which are time-invariant. But “lfe” has an advantage, it allows you to estimate fixed effect with clustered standard errors, which I wish “panelr” can do too.</p>

<p>In this BW model, we have the fixed effect model coefficient on age, which is .0181. The coeffcient on mage (.0044) is the “contextual effect” of between effect of age, that is, the addtional effect of between effect on logged wage. The between effect should be .0044+.0181=.0225. And we have the effect of time-invariant covariate race estimated. The advantage of using xtreg is that we have clustered standard errors implemented.</p>

<h1>BW model in non-linear models</h1>
<p>Paul Allison in his blog(<a href="https://statisticalhorizons.com/between-within-contextual-effects" class="uri">https://statisticalhorizons.com/between-within-contextual-effects</a>) mentioned using BW model for a binary outcome. I have not dig into the literature to see how large the bias can be using the BW , comparing to, say a conditional logit model. But if OLS is a good linear approximation of a logit model, BW model could be a good approximation with a binary outcome with panel data.</p>
