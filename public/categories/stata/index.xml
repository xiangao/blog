      <description>Traditional mediation analysis We summarized how to do traditional mediation analysis (Baron and Kenny, 1986) with R and Stata in my last blog about mediation.
Traditionally mediation model can be represented in the following equations:
\[ Y = a A + b M + \epsilon_1 \]
\[ M = c A + \epsilon_2 \]
There are three main variables, A (treatment, or exposure), M (mediator) and Y (outcome). There are two pathways from A to Y, a direct effect, and an indirect effect through A -&amp;gt; M -&amp;gt; Y.</description>

      <title>When is OLS coefficient the ATE</title>

      <description>OLS cannot be ATE (most of the time) Tymon Słoczyński has this cool paper(https://people.brandeis.edu/~tslocz/Sloczynski_paper_regression.pdf) which helps me understand OLS better.
A common setup in empirical studies:
\[ y = \alpha + \tau d + X \beta \]
\(d\) is the treatment dummy, \(X\) is the covariates. This model assumes homogeneous treatment effect. That is, \(\tau\) is the ATE if treatment effect is homogeneous. But, if not, then \(\tau\) is not ATE anymore, although most people treat it as ATE.</description>

      <title>Mundlak device in fixed effect models</title>

      <description>TWFE Two-way fixed effect model has been widely used, especially in difference-in-difference situation, when we have a panel data with pre and post data. The basic setup is:
\[ y_{it} = X_{it} \beta + c_i + f_t + u_{it} \]
with \(X\) has \(k\) variables, \(t\) has \(T\) periods, and \(i\) has \(N\) units.
For a linear model, we know we can put in \(k\) unit dummies and \(T\) time dummies to estimate the model.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Control in R and Stata</title>

      <description>Synthetic control Abadie et al. have a few papers on synthetic control (https://economics.mit.edu/files/11859, https://economics.mit.edu/files/17847). The key idea is for a case study situation. A single unit, say a state/firm/country is exposed to a shock, and we are interested in the effect of that shock. For example, Card et al studied the effect of minimum wage increase for the state of New Jersey. They used diff-in-diff, with Pennsylvania as the control state.</description>

      <title>Mediation analysis in R and Stata</title>

      <description>Mediation analysis Traditionally mediation model can be represented in the following equestions:
\[ Y = a X + b M + \epsilon_1 \] \[ M = c X + \epsilon_2 \]
That is, we’d like to study the effect of \(X\) on \(Y\), and we see the effect can be a direct effect, and an indirect effect, through \(M\).
Baron and Kenny’s (http://davidakenny.net/cm/mediate.htm) method is done in four steps. Modern approach tends to use SEM (structural equation modeling) to model these two equations directly.</description>

      <title>Fixed or Random Effect, or Both?</title>

      <description>Panel data When we have a panel data (repeated observations over time, or observations clustered at higher level), we usually think of two choices: random effect or fixed effect? Economists usually prefers fixed effect models, since it wipes out all within unit heterogeneity. Economists do not like random effect models since it has a big assumption: the random effects need to be uncorrelated to other covariates in the model. To see this, suppose we have</description>

      <title>Comparing Marginal effects with margins command</title>

      <description>Comparing Marginal effects Stata’s margins command has been a powerful tool for many economists. It can calculate predicted means as well as predicted marginal effects. Sometimes we’d like to compare those marginal effects. People use margins and marginsplot to generate marginal effects; then draw conclusions on whether there is a difference between marginal effects, based on whether the confidence intervals overlap or not. However, that can actually be wrong.</description>

      <description>Marginal effects in a linear model Stata’s margins command has been a powerful tool for many economists. It can calculate predicted means as well as predicted marginal effects. However, we do need to be careful when we use it when fixed effects are included. In a linear model, everything works out fine. However, in a non-linear model, you may not want to use margins, since it’s not calculating what you have in mind.</description>

      <description>Treatment effects in observational studies Despite the popularity of randomized experiements in economics nowadays, most situations we have observational data in economic studies. One reason is experiemnts are expensive; the other reason is that sometimes it is simply not feasible to have experiments. If we have observational data, and we’d like to draw causal conclusions, then we have a few different situations. The worse situation is that we have an endogenous treatement.</description>

      <title>Interaction term in a non-linear model</title>

      <description>Interaction term in a non-linear model In a non-linear model (for example, logit or poisson model), the interpretation of the coefficient on the interaction term is tricky. Ai and Norton (2003) points out that the interaction term coefficient is not the same as people can interpret as in a linear model; that is, how much effect of \(x1\) changes with the value of \(x2\). They interpret this as a cross</description>

      <description>Interaction with two binary variables In a regression model with interaction term, people tend to pay attention to only the coefficient of the interaction term.
Let’s start with the simpliest situation: \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are binary and coded 0/1.
\[ E(y) = \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_{12} x_1x_2 \]
In this case, we have a saturated model; that is, we have three coefficients representing additive effects from the baseline situation (both \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) being 0).</description>
