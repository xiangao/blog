      <description>Interaction term in a non-linear model In a non-linear model (for example, logit or poisson model), the interpretation of the coefficient on the interaction term is tricky. Ai and Norton (2003) points out that the interaction term coefficient is not the same as people can interpret as in a linear model; that is, how much effect of \(x1\) changes with the value of \(x2\). They interpret this as a cross</description>

      <description>Interaction with two binary variables In a regression model with interaction term, people tend to pay attention to only the coefficient of the interaction term.
Let’s start with the simpliest situation: \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) are binary and coded 0/1.
\[ E(y) = \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_{12} x_1x_2 \]
In this case, we have a saturated model; that is, we have three coefficients representing additive effects from the baseline situation (both \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) being 0).</description>
