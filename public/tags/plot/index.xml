      <description>In this post, I’ll use simulated data to see how a few recently developed causal inference packages work.
In other posts, I have discussed some methods involving machine learning, such as TMLE, or causal forest. This time we’ll talk about nonparametric methods and double machine learning.
Identification First suppose we have a “target” parameter in mind, which is some function of the some unknown distribution \(P^*\), called a functional, say \(\psi^*(P^*)\).</description>

      <description>A comparison of various count data models with extra zeros In empirical studies, data sets with a lot of zeros are often hard to model. There are various models to deal with it: zero-inflated Poisson model, Negative Binomial (NB)model, hurdle model, etc.
Here we are following a zero-inflated model’s thinking: model the data with two processes. One is a Bernoulli process, the other one is a count data process (Poisson or NB).</description>

      <description>A simulation for an OLS model In an observational study, we need to assume we have the functional form to get causal effect estimated correctly, in addtion to the assumption of treatment being exogenous.
